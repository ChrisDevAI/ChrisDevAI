# AI/ML Engineer  
Machine Learning • NLP • Computer Vision • Deep Learning • Large Language Models

I build real-world AI systems with a focus on clarity, reliability, and strong engineering discipline. My background centers on applied artificial intelligence, modern software development, and hands on project execution across language models, computer vision, and data processing pipelines.

My work emphasizes clean architecture, explainable workflows, and production minded design.

I am completing my Bachelor of Applied Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence while building a portfolio of end-to-end AI/ML engineering projects.
I am open to relocation and actively preparing for full-time AI/ML engineer roles.
